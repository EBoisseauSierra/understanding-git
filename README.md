# _"Understanding git"_ course

This repo contains material of a git course for (and by) the Data Science team.
The course is intended for both novice and those who use git yet sometime struggle to know which command to use to fix the mess of their repo.

## Objective
The objective of this course is to provide a simple _understanding_ of how git works.
We firmly believe that this will make the process of _learning_ (and then _using_) git easier.
No prior exposure to git is required.
